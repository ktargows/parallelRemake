The `parallelRemake` package is a helper add-on for [`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake), a [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)-like reproducible build system for R. If you haven't done so already, go learn [`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake)! Also learn [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), and then recall that `make -j 4` runs a [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) while distributing the rules over four parallel processes. This mode of parallelism is the whole point of `parallelRemake`. With `parallelRemake`, you can write an overarching [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for a [`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake) project to run [`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake) targets in parallel. This distributed parallelism is extremely helpful for large clusters that use the [Slurm job scheduler](http://slurm.schedmd.com/), for example, as explained in [this post](http://plindenbaum.blogspot.com/2014/09/parallelizing-gnu-make-4-in-slurm.html).

# Rtools for Windows users

The example and tests sometimes use `system("make")` and similar commands. So if you're using the Windows operating system, you will need to install the [`Rtools`](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Install-Rtools-for-Windows) package.

# Help and troubleshooting

Use the `help_parallelRemake()` function to obtain a collection of helpful links. For troubleshooting, please refer to [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](https://github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake) for instructions.

# Examples

Run `list_examples_parallelRemake()` to see the available examples, and run `example_parallelRemake()` to output an example to your current working directory. To run the basic example,

1. Call `example_parallelRemake("basic")` in an R session. 
2. Call `setwd("basic")` to enter the `"basic"` folder.
3. call `write_makefile()` to generate the `Makefile`.
4. Use [`Makefile`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to run the workflow. Do any of the following in any order.
    - `system("make")` just runs the workflow in 1 process.
    - `system("make -j 2")` distributes the workflow over two parallel processes.
    - `system("make clean")` removes the files created by [`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake).
    
# More on `write_makefile()`

The `write_makefile()` function has additional arguments. You can control the names of the [`Makefile`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and the [`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake)/[`YAML`](http://yaml.org/) file with the `makefile` and `remakefile` arguments, respectively. You can add lines to the beginning of the [`Makefile`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) with the `begin` argument, which could be useful for setting up the workflow for execution on a cluster, for example. You can append commands to `make clean` with the `clean` argument. In addition, the `remake_args` argument passes additional arguments to `remake::make()`. For example, `write_makefile(remake_args = list(verbose = FALSE))` is equivalent to `remake::make(..., verbose = F)` for each target. You cannot set `target_names` or `remake_file` this way.

# High-performance computing

If you want to run `make -j` to distribute tasks over multiple nodes of a [Slurm](http://slurm.schedmd.com/) cluster, you should generate a Makefile like the one in [this post](http://plindenbaum.blogspot.com/2014/09/parallelizing-gnu-make-4-in-slurm.html).
To do this, run the following in an R session

```{r, eval = F}
write_makefile(..., 
  begin = c(
    "SHELL=srun",
    ".SHELLFLAGS= <ARGS> bash -c"))
```

where `<ARGS>` stands for additional arguments to `srun`. Then, once the [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is generated, you distribute
the work over `[N]` simultaneous jobs by running the following in the 
[Linux command line](http://linuxcommand.org/).

```r
nohup nice -19 make -j [N] &
```

For other task managers such as [PBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System), you  may have to create a custom stand-in for a shell. 
For example, suppose we are using the Univa Grid Engine. From R, call

```r
write_makefile(.., begin = "SHELL = ./shell.sh")
```

where the file `shell.sh` contains

```r
#!/bin/bash
shift
echo "module load R; $*" | qsub -sync y -cwd -j y
```

Now, in the Linux command line, enable execution with

```r
chmod +x shell.sh
```

and then distribute the work over `[N]` simultaneous jobs with

```r
nohup nice -19 make -j [N] &
```

The same approach should work for [LSF systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_LSF), where `make` replaced by [lsmake](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSETD4_9.1.3/lsf_admin/lsmake_how_works_lsf.html) and the [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is compatible.

Regardless of the system, be sure that all nodes point to the same working directory so that they share the same `.remake` [storr](https://github.com/richfitz/storr) cache. For the Univa Grid Engine, the `-cwd` flag for `qsub` accomplishes this.

# Use with the [downsize](https://github.com/wlandau/downsize) package

The <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/downsize">downsize</a> package is compatible with <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake">parallelRemake</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/remakeGenerator">remakeGenerator</a> workflows, and the <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/remakeGenerator/blob/master/vignettes/remakeGenerator.Rmd">remakeGenerator vignette</a> explains how to use these packages together.

# Accessing the [`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake) cache for debugging and testing

Intermediate [`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake) objects are maintained in [`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake)'s hidden [`storr`](https://github.com/richfitz/storr) cache. At any point in the workflow, you can reload them using `recall(name)`, where `name` is a character string denoting the name of a cached object, and you can see the names of all the available objects with the `recallable()` function. Enter multiple names to return a named list of multiple objects (i.e., `recall(name1, name2)`). **Important: this is only recommended for debugging and testing. Changes to the cache are not tracked and thus not reproducible.**

The functions `create_bindings()` and `make_environment()` are alternatives from [`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake) itself. Just be careful with `create_bindings()` if your project has a lot of data.

# Multiple [`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake)/[`YAML`](http://yaml.org/) files

[`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake) has the option to split the workflow over multiple [`YAML`](http://yaml.org/) files and collate them with the "include:" field. If that's the case, just specify all the root nodes in the `remakefiles` argument to `write_makefile()`. (You could also specify every single [`YAML`](http://yaml.org/) file, but that's tedious.) If needed, `write_makefile()` will recursively combine the targets, sources, etc. in the constituent `remakefiles` and output a new collated [`YAML`](http://yaml.org/) file that the master [`Makefile`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) will then use.
